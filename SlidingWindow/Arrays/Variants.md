### **1. Fixed-size Sliding Window**

* Maximum/Minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements
* Maximum/Minimum average of `k` consecutive elements
* Maximum/Minimum product of `k` consecutive elements
* Maximum/Minimum element in every window of size `k`
* Count of subarrays of size `k` satisfying a condition

### **2. Variable-size (Dynamic) Sliding Window**

* Longest substring/subarray with **at most K distinct elements**
* Longest substring/subarray with **exactly K distinct elements**
* Longest substring/subarray with **no repeating elements**
* Longest substring/subarray with **sum ≤ or = target**
* Shortest substring/subarray with **sum ≥ target**
* Count of subarrays with **sum ≤ or = target**
* Count of subarrays with **exactly K distinct elements**

---

### **3. Maximum/Minimum Window Problems**

* Maximum sum subarray of size `k`
* Minimum sum subarray of size `k`
* Maximum product subarray of size `k`
* Maximum/minimum in sliding window (Deque-based approach)

---

### **4. Pattern Matching / Frequency Problems**

* Count anagrams of a pattern in a string/array
* Subarrays with certain frequency of elements
* Longest subarray with elements satisfying a frequency constraint

---

### **5. Other Variants**

* Subarrays/substrings with sum divisible by `k`
* Subarrays with at most/least `x` zeros/ones (binary arrays)
* Circular array window problems
