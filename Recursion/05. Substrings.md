## **Print All Subsequences of a String**

### **Problem**

Given a string `s`, print **all possible subsequences** of the string.

* **Subsequence:** A sequence that can be derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
* **Example:** `"abc"` → `["", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]`

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Backtracking / Recursion** – At each step, you **decide whether to include or exclude** the current character.
2. **Base Case** – When you reach the end of the string, print/store the current accumulated subsequence.
3. **Recursive Case** – Two choices for each character:

   * Include it in the current subsequence
   * Exclude it from the current subsequence

### **Step-by-Step Example: `"ab"`**

Start with empty subsequence `""`:

```
1. Include 'a' → subsequence = "a"
   - Include 'b' → subsequence = "ab" (print)
   - Exclude 'b' → subsequence = "a" (print)

2. Exclude 'a' → subsequence = ""
   - Include 'b' → subsequence = "b" (print)
   - Exclude 'b' → subsequence = "" (print)
```

All subsequences: `["", "a", "b", "ab"]`

### **Code Example (Java)**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Subsequences {
    public static void printSubsequences(String str) {
        printSubsequencesHelper(str, 0, "");
    }

    private static void printSubsequencesHelper(String str, int index, String current) {
        // Base case: reached end of string
        if (index == str.length()) {
            System.out.println(current);
            return;
        }

        // Include the current character
        printSubsequencesHelper(str, index + 1, current + str.charAt(index));

        // Exclude the current character
        printSubsequencesHelper(str, index + 1, current);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abc";
        printSubsequences(s);
    }
}
```

### **Output for `"abc"`**

```
abc
ab
ac
a
bc
b
c
(empty string)
```

---

### **Key Points**

1. Uses **recursion + backtracking** pattern.
2. **Decision at each step:** include or exclude the character.
3. Total subsequences = (2^n) for a string of length `n` → exponential time.
4. Can be **stored in a list** if needed instead of printing.
